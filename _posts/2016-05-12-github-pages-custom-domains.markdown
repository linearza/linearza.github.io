I am finally back online. After wrestling with github pages and getting my apex domain (this one) working alongside subdomains that I use for my projects I finally concluded that it was simply not going to happen, and gave in. 
<!-- 
But alas! The phoenix has risen! After finally regaining some motivation to look into this again and get my blog up and running I came across [this][this] helpful rundown by Jake Zimmerman. 

Turns out, in my case, that I simply had to change my `CNAME` reference from my top level domain of `linear.co.za` to my `www` subdomain, as such: `www.linear.co.za`. 
After that I simply updated my DNS records to point my apex record to the [provided][ip] (`192.30.252.153`) github ip, and *viola*!

Here I am again. Time to start blogging.
